# UniPark
UniPark is a full stack parking spot booking application that allows users to list their own parking spots and book other spots for specific time ranges. The backend prevents overlapping bookings to ensure spots cannot be double-booked.

• Create and list parking spots
• View all available parking spots
• Book parking spots using fullname, start time, and end time
• Backend validation to prevent overlapping bookings
• View booking history
